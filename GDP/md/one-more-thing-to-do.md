I have a bad news and a good news. The signup process isn't over yet. 

![One more thing to do](/img/youre-here.png)

I want to know that my email arrived at your inbox safely. Because it's an **email** newsletter.

It's odd if you signed up an email newsletter but you cannot receive emails from me.

That's why I added this step. 

And it's time for the good news. 

If you click the confirm button in the confirmation email, you'll get instant access to the secret resource page. 

And you can download every bonus like cheatsheet, ebook, example files, etc.

Please sign in to your email inbox and check your email.

If you're a Gmail user, you can go to your inbox instantly by clicking link below: 

[Go to Gmail](https://gmail.com)

Sometimes, it can take about 10 minutes. But if you couldn't get the email even after 15 minutes, please send me an email to support@unitycook.com
