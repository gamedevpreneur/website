[Title]C# 101: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners[/Title]

![Who made these all?](/img/cs4b/0-hub/who-made-these.png)

Windows. Mac. iOS. PowerPoint. Gmail. Excel. Evernote. Chrome. Super Mario Bros. Overwatch....

Our life is filled with programs. We cannot live without them. 

But sometimes, they make us think:

Who made all of these? How did they do that? Can I do that, too?

Yes. You can. You’ll learn how soon. 

![It’s dangerous outside.](/img/cs4b/0-hub/dangerous.png)

Note. If you’re a JavaScript expert, you can learn C# faster by comparing C# and JavaScript.

# Part 1. C# Programming Basics

[ContentCard]
What is programming exactly? 
/programming
/img/cs4b/1-prog/thumbnail.png
====
We all know that programmers make programs. But how do they do that? How can we make computers obey our commands? 
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
Your first program in C#: Hello World and Professor Oak. 
/first-program-in-csharp
/img/cs4b/2-first/thumbnail.png
====
An experience is better than a thousand words. Let’s learn what programming is by making your first program in C#. 
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
Variables: Let’s work with data in C#. 
/variables-of-csharp
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
To make the right decision, we need data. Then, how should we store them to use later? How can we create new data from current ones? 
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
Control Statements: Doing the right things at the right time
/control-statements-in-csharp
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
To get things done, we need to do the right things at the right time. This fact doesn’t change in the computer world. 

Then, the question is: how can we make computers do that? 
[/ContentCard]

C# Practice 1: One-room dungeon. 
/csharp-practice-1
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
We learned the basics to control computers. So, let’s make a really simple game with our current knowledge. 

We’ll review the things in previous chapters. And we’ll also learn the process you can use to make the programs you desire. 
[/ContentCard]

# Part 2. More about C#

[ContentCard]
Data Structure in C#: Arrays, Lists and Dictionaries
/csharp-data-structure
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
When we learned variables, we focused on handling single variables.

But in the real world, there are many lists of data like students in a class, items in a supermarket, videos in a YouTube channel. 

How should we handle them?
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
Methods: One step isn’t one step. 
/csharp-methods
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
In many times, we realize later that a simple step in a project isn’t that simple and requires multiple sub-steps to finish it. 

It’s not different in the computer world. Then, how should we package those sub-steps into a single step in C#? 
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
C# Practice 2: 3-room dungeon
/csharp-practice-2
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
You learned more advanced features in C# programming. Let’s review them by expanding our single-room dungeon to 3 rooms. 
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
Object-Oriented Programming in C#: Don’t be offended. You’re an object. 
/csharp-oop
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
Every program interprets and mimics a small part of our world. 

Let’s learn how Object Oriented Programming helps us do that better. 
[/ContentCard]

C# Practice 3: Add Boss Room
/csharp-practice-3
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
We’ll redesign our dungeon with OOP. And we’ll add a boss room.
[/ContentCard]

# Bonuses

You learned how to use C#. You can safely say that you know how to use C#. 

But unfortunately, there are some more things that'll make your programming life easier. 

[ContentCard]
Bonus 1. How to use Visual Studio Debugger. 
/visual-studio-debugger
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
Debugger shows you what’s going on in the program so that you find bugs fast. 

You’ll find bugs soon enough. 
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
Bonus 2. How to handle files in C#
/handle-files-in-csharp
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
Although we created a lot of programs to learn C#, they can’t save data permanently. The data we created with them are lost forever when we close them. 

Then, how should we save data to files? This article has the answer.
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
Bonus 3. Visual Studio Tutorial
/visual-studio-tutorial
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
We learned how to create projects, add files and compile. But they’re not everything. There’s more. 

You’ll learn advanced features like adding more projects to a solution, using code snippets and more. 
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard]
Bonus 4. LINQ
/linq
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
You learned the basics of data structures in Chapter 4. But you didn’t learn the true power of them. 

With LINQ, you can unlock their full power and do various things in a few lines.
