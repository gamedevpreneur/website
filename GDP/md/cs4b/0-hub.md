[Title]C# 101: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners[/Title]

![Who made these all?](/img/cs4b/0-hub/who-made-these.png)

Windows. Mac. iOS. 
PowerPoint. Gmail. Excel. Evernote. Chrome. 
Super Mario Bros. Overwatch....

Our life is filled with programs. We cannot live without them. 

But sometimes, they make us think:

Who made all of these? How did they do that? Can I do that, too?

Yes. You can. When you know how. 

And you'll learn how soon. 

![!!It’s dangerous to go alone. Take these programming tools.](/img/cs4b/0-hub/dangerous.png)

[Note]
If you’re a JavaScript expert, you can [learn C# faster by comparing C# and JavaScript](/csharp-for-js-devs).

# Part 1. C# Basics

You'll learn how to control your computer with C# programming language.

Chapter 1. What is programming exactly? 
/programming
/img/cs4b/1-prog/thumbnail.png
====
We all know that programmers make programs. But how do they do that? How can we make computers obey our commands?

Chapter 2. Your first program in C#: Hello World and Professor Oak. 
/first-program-in-csharp
/img/cs4b/2-first/thumbnail.png
====
An experience is better than a thousand words. Let’s learn what programming is by making your first program in C#.

Chapter 3. Variables: Let’s work with data in C#. 
/variables-in-csharp
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
To make the right decision, we need data. Then, how should we create and store them to use later? How can we create new data from current ones? 
[/ContentCard]

Chapter 4. Control Statements: Doing the right things at the right moment
/control-statements-in-csharp
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
To get things done, we need to do the right things at the right moment. This fact doesn’t change in the computer world. 

Then, the question is: how can we make computers do that? 
[/ContentCard]

Project 1. One-room dungeon. 
/csharp-practice-1
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
We learned the basics to control computers. So, let’s make a really simple game with our current knowledge. 

We’ll review variables and control statements. And we’ll also learn the steps you can take to make the programs you desire. 
[/ContentCard]

# Part 2. More about C&#35;

To make a bigger program, you need to know how to organize your code. And below covers how.

Chapter 5. Data Structure in C#: Arrays, Lists and Dictionaries
/csharp-data-structure
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
When we learned variables, we focused on handling single variables.

But in the real world, we can find many lists of data like students in a class, items in a supermarket, videos in a YouTube channel. 

How should we handle them?
[/ContentCard]

Chapter 6. Methods: One step isn’t one step. 
/csharp-methods
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
A simple step in a project isn’t that simple and requires multiple sub-steps to finish it. 

It’s not different in the computer world. Then, how should we package those sub-steps into a single step in C#? 
[/ContentCard]

Project 2. 3-room dungeon
/csharp-practice-2
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
You learned more advanced features in C# programming. Let’s review them by expanding our single-room dungeon to 3 rooms. 
[/ContentCard]

Chapter 7. Object-Oriented Programming in C#: Don’t be offended. You’re an object. 
/csharp-oop
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
Every program interprets and mimics a small part of our world. 

Let’s learn how Object Oriented Programming helps us do that better. 
[/ContentCard]

Project 3. Add Boss Room
/csharp-practice-3
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
We’ll redesign our dungeon with OOP. And we’ll add a boss room.

# Part 3. Bonuses

With 7 chapters and 3 projects under your belt, you can safely say that you know C#. 

But unfortunately, it doesn't mean you know everything that expert developers use. 

In this bonus part, I've covered some more topics that'll make your programming life easier. 

[ContentCard preparation="true"]
Bonus 1. How to use Visual Studio Debugger. 
/visual-studio-debugger
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
Debugger shows you what’s going on in the program so that you find bugs fast. 

Let's learn how to use it and save time!
[/ContentCard]

Bonus 2. How to handle files in C#
/handle-files-in-csharp
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
Although we created a lot of programs to learn C#, they can’t save data permanently. The data we created with them are lost forever when we close them. 

Then, how should we save data to files? This article has the answer.
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard preparation="true"]
Bonus 3. Visual Studio Tutorial
/visual-studio-tutorial
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
We learned how to create projects, add files and compile. But they’re not everything. There’s more. 

You’ll learn advanced features like adding more projects to a solution, using code snippets and more. 
[/ContentCard]

[ContentCard preparation="true"]
Bonus 4. LINQ
/linq
/img/cs4b/under-preparation.png
====
You learned the basics of data structures in Chapter 4. But you didn’t learn the true power.

With LINQ, you can unlock their full power. LINQ helps us do a lot of complicated things in just a few lines.
